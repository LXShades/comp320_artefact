# Impostor Layer Experiment (COMP320/COMP360)
## Overview
This is a simple shooting game utilising an impostor-based rendering system in the background to improve performance and gain an understanding of the player response to incongruencies as a result of flatenning sections of the 3D image.

That is my dissertation proposal in less than 1% of the words. Inflation is high in this market!

## Status
Progress of the artefact can be summarised as:
+ Add impostor renderers
- Refine impostor renderers
- Add shooting game with balloon enemies
- Add questionnaires
- Add data collection
- Add csv exports

Note the +, meaning the objective has been achieved, and the - meaning it has yet to be finished.
